- This is a chart that shows how it increases chance to obtain unique/set/rare/magic items.

- Magic find has 50% chance to trigger when an item drops.
- This is how group magic find is calculated:
- Magic find of players on the dungeon level where the item dropped gets sorted in descending order.
- Total MF value starts with being 0.
- Highest magic find gets added to it, then second highest/2, third highest/3 and so on.
- This prevents people from getting absurdly high MF values while being in a group while still being a gain
- during playing with other people.
