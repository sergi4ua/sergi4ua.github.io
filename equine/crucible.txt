====================== RULES ============================

Crucible is designed around the assumption that the player obeys certain rules of play:


*Single Player:
-While playable in multi player, Crucible has been designed and balanced around the single player game


*Hardcore:
-If the player character dies at any time they must be deleted and cannot reload any prior saved games
	*Re-loading from a prior save is allowed if a death or crash occurs due to a bug or glitch in the game
	*Re-loading from a prior save is allowed if a bug or glitch makes progress through the game impossible
	*Should a player accidentally re-load from a prior save they may play on from that save

-You may not start a new game with an old character
	*This is to prevent repeating content


*Full Clears:
-Every quest on a dungeon level must be completed before progressing to the next
	*Any quest that does not require monsters to be killed does not have to be completed (e.g. Black Mushroom)

-Every monster on a dungeon level must be killed before progressing to the next
	*A sound will play when every monster on the current level is killed
	*Loot and loot containers may remain untouched
		*Sarcophagi and barrels must be opened if skeletons of any type are present on the level
	*The final chamber opened on level 16 does not need to be fully cleared before killing Diablo
		*This cannot be exploited to kill Diablo with holybolt while he is trapped by his minions
	*The player must be alive when Diablo dies and the final cinematic plays


*No Abuse:
-Abusing bugs or glitches at any point in the game is disallowed
	*This includes getting monsters stuck in staircases
	*This includes intentionally parking monsters where their attacks can never hit you while you can attack them with impunity
		*This does not include trapping monsters behind doors who are unable to open doors
		*This does not include luring monsters one-by-one and other manipulation of monster aggression
	*This includes getting King Leoric stuck on the grated wall in the middle of his tomb
	*This includes entering and leaving the dungeon solely/repeatedly to restock Adria/Griswold/Wirt
	*This does not include the extra spells cast at no mana cost when spamming right-click in combat
		*This exception does not apply to deliberate exploitation of this bug


*The Golden Rules:
-The spirit of the rules is more important than the letter
-If it feels like it might be wrong then you're probably right
-These rules are a guideline on how to get the most fun and challenge from the mod: there is no obligation to abide by them
