	v0.2029 (3:28 14.02.2018)

+	Base character damage adjusted to compliment twohanded weapons, now these weapons increase damage a lot,
	new conditionas are as follows:
	if a character has 2h weapon equipped and the type of the weapon is sharp or blunt,then base damage formula is:
	Gladiator: (clvl * (cSTR+cVIT) / 55) + 2,
	Monk:  (CLVL * (cSTR + cVIT) / 60) + 4 (same damage with axes),
	Paladin: (clvl * (cSTR+cVIT) / 45 ) + 5;
+	Monk attacks adjacent targets when using poleaxe weapons;
+	Experimental feature: when jog is on, running is allowed when in dungeon and not in battle,
	Note: this works even in quest areas,
	Note: this can be turned off/on in config.ini (set runindungeon on/off);


	v0.2054 (1:46 26.02.2018)

+	Shield was losing durability according to old Diablo 1 rules: fixed;
+	Potion shift-clicking fixed: character no longer begins attacking during this;
+	Pressing ALT highlights items on the ground;
+	Some known bugs fixed;
+	Added a lot of new base items (subclass-specific items don't work properly, they are being merely prepared);


	v0.2089 (7:31 11.03.2018)

+	Finished adding sharp type items. All the old sharp weapon data is updated as well;
+	Finished adding randomization on base items (dur, danage, requirements). Only some shields remain;

+	Pressing SHIFT+TAB while minimap is on, will auto-adjust its position to northwest corner of the screen;
+	Default monster blue item drop chance set to 5% (unique: 1%), boss unique item chance set to 10%;
+	Added magic find affixes,
	Note: MF percentage increases monster magic item find chance in direct percentage,
	Note: if total MF is +100% then chance to find blue item from monster is 10% multipled by 2 (resulting in 20%),
	Note: unique item find chance for monsters and  bosses is quartered (25% in strength),
	Note: for ex., if total MF on a character is +200% then chance to find unique from a boss is 10% multipled by 1,5 (resulting in 15%);
+	Map blend in/out implemented. Adjust with Shift+/Shift-,
	Note: it's on by default. In case of display bugs, set 'set mapblend on' line in config to off;


	v0.2153 (21:53 10.04.2018)

+	Rare items are introduced as a possible drop from bosses,
	Note: this item type is fucntional but not really ready - yes, there will be morphing next time;
+	Items show info in floating pop-up windows now. To turn off set in config 'set infotip' to off;
+	TONS of base items are updated. But finally, they are brought to what I might name finalized state;
+	Adjusted some affixes;
+	Various other things done about development, just a usual chore, nothing in particular;

+	Rare items generate now 1 negative affix (to remain within item power 2 range, for balance' sake);
+	Critical damage affixes updated;
+	Other fixes or reported bugs and general work with base items;


	v0.2234 (15:03 10.05.2018)

+	Relocated character rebound damage to a table, warriors and fighters have Reflect that does criticals now;
+	Rare items no longer generated with negative affixes;
+	Rare items now use a different affix table which allows to have 4 positive affixes without breaking balance;
+	ARD removed from magic item affix table and no longer needed, ARD defense works by default;
+	Sorted out affixes for magic and rare items, adjusted balancing, prices, levels and values for them all;
+	Affix of '+XP gain' works now after affix of '+% XP gain';
+	Rare items now use pink color;

+	Double manacost for spells fixed (hopefully);
+	Fixed critical damage affix randomize bug (randomization of values wasn't working);
+	Added options to control regeneration floating number thresholds,
	Note: adjust numbers for these lines in config: set floatingHPRegenThreshold #, set floatingManaRegenThreshold #,
	Note: this will adjust how strong regeneration must be for you to see it happening,
	Note: works by hiding the regeneration of given strength an below. For ex., 2 for mana will only show regen of +3 and higher;


	v0.2381 (22:37 24.05.2018), "Strangers in the Night"

+	Builds now will have code names, just like rock band albums. For better distinction and for fun. This one is after Sinatra's song;
+	Affixes of flat +XP values are randomized now (will show +X-Y to XP instead of +X to XP);
+	Crossbows show 'slow damage' in Griswold's and Wirt's shop menu;
+	When items reach 1 current durability, they will give floating warnings each time max durability goes down, it's optional and adjusted in config;
+	Message log added in MP mode. Hit '0' to bring it up. Close by left clicking outside the window or pressing 'back';
+	Character base resistances changed. Used to be all bVIT/16, now fire is bSTR/10, lightning bDEX/10, magic bMAG/10 (acid and cold unsupported yet);

	Note: basically, it's caved in Ironman in one go. Can't use stash, go up in levels, only have one go,
	Note: game can't be saved and characterfile is instantly deleted when you leave game. This is purely automatic,
	Note: when you die, you can only choose ABANDON GAME option, which deletes your character,
	Note: activate by naming your character NM_#your name# (for ex., NM_myrogue),
	Note: TP relicts/books/shrines - don't work (TP shrine gives two random elixirs instead! No, it won't drop spectral ;D ),
	Note: but to sweeten the deal, magic find is  set to +100% at the start, bosses always frop 2 ID relix,
	Note: bosses drop repair oil, which gets better as you go deeper (tier 1 til dlvl-5, tier 2 til dlvl-9, 3 til 17, and 4 after),
	Note: also, firearrow trap damage is reduced by 75%;
+	Meta menu post image freezes fixed where possible;

+	Added config option to control floating indicators of damage recieved by monsters (MonsterReceivedDamageThreshold);

	Note: player can SAVE & QUIT if last dungeon area level is cleared (dlvls 4/8/12/16/20/24),
	Note: in SP save game and load game are disabled, in MP new game and quit options are disabled until save point is reached;

+	Character melee damage resistance formula revised (shown in percentage):
	minimum resistance: CLVL / 8 + bVIT / 16 + 1,
	maximum resistance: CLVL / 3 + bVIT / 8 + 5,
	Note: Monks have +2 to min and +3 to max, Rogues have +3 to min and +5 to max on top of that;
+	Added support (and affixes) for summoned minions: +HPs, +% HPs, +ToHit, +AC, +%AC (deactived tho), +%damage, +damage,
	Note: right now  these improve Golem simply because there are no other summoned minions;
+	Under HP bars, monsters will show squares colored in the style of their immunities:
	fire - orange, lightning - beige, magic - crimson, curse - white, acid - yellow, cold is.. not supported yet;
+	Another fix to gold generating as rare item;
+	FFS so much is being done that I can't really remember what was added to report it here, anyway, monster HP bar is updated;

	Note: max block chance is still 35% though, might need a raise in future to about 45-65% since it's only 2 frames;
+	Recolored Bile Demons and their bosses. Changes are not drastic but I had to recolor them from scratch to make them look better;

+	Upgraded a lot of affix data;
+	Added Walock grimoire list;
+	Changed looks of some jewelry;
+	Added system of Perks. They will be assigned to characters retroactively;
	Note: formula is CLVL-1 perks for character (e.g., if you are level 17, you get 16 perk points),
	Note: yes, they do make the mod easier. No, I will not increase difficulty to compensate for that. Yes, I think that's ok;
+	Perk window is opened by [P] hotkey now. Added a button near mana orb, which is used to open perk window,
	Note: it replaces Friendly Fire switch in MP mode, but since it wasn't used really, I decided it's alright for now,
	Note: if need be, FF switch will be restored;

+	Fixed white items showing red text;


	v0.4000 (19:26 24.06.2018), "It's so easy"

+	This one's after Willy DeVille (suggested songs didn't beat this one, closest was Alleria and his "Dead Can Dance - Opium");
+	Affix segregation introduced: afixes are now of battle/magic/combo type. Same with base items. This will create a better affix distribution. This applies to rare items as well;
+	Regeneration of life and mana rules were modified. Now it's +1 per each 20 current points of MAG/VIT, and randomizers are turned off,
	Note: this means there will be no more jumping values in character sheet;
+	Some minor GUI improvements;
+	Fixed PvP ranged battle. Wasn't functional;
+	Fixed stash item corruption bug which was discovered after v0.3000 public release,
	Note: sorry about that, if your stash file was corrupted, you will have to delete it, it won't be a subject to repair,
	Note: on the bright side, it's fortunate it didn't happen after v1.00 release. That's why we have testing builds;

	Note: there used to be 6 classes, now there are 29,

+	Items now have full support for class/subclass/specialization requirements;
+	Character level requirement support added for base items;
+	In SP items that cannot be worn by class restrictions do not drop, and do not sell,
	Note: this will dramatically reduce the type of items you get thus increasing percentage of useful ones as well,
	Note: in MP you will still get a lot of items, as before, and this could get changed in next builds, we'll see;
+	Game mode is no longer selected by giving character a certain name, it is now chosen during character creation;
+	Champions now give +50% experience points;
+	Magic find is now +100% for Ironman mode;
+	Overtime mode removed and not supported anymore;
+	Setup is available in multiplayer modes of Ironman and Nightmare;
+	Generation of Town Portal relicts/books/staves is now forbidden in Ironman and Nightmare modes;
+	In IM/NM modes, if it's SP mode and current player is of Mage type, bosses drop magic books with 33% chance, instead of a magic item;
+	Item class requirement displayed in red if class doesn't match;
+	In SP Ironman or Nightmare mode portal to Lazarus level is now opened by right-clicking Lazarus staff;
+	In multiplayer extra game modes are not checked for connectivity, this will be taken care of somewhat later;

+	Added a more powerful affix of '+all stats' type: of 'the elders' (generated only on amulets);
+	Adjusted all other affixes completely, all over again. Excluded undesirable generations and combinations, revised numbers, rearranged among item types;


	v0.4100 (10:23 11.07.2018)

+	Segregation of affixes expanded to "understand" difference between 1H/2H sharps/blunts;
+	Armor racks no longer allow for incompatible class drops;
+	PvM Ranged combat code is improved. Preparations made for improvements. Frozen for now;
+	Created a line of 6 new unique items (based on Sash);
+	Improved quality of some base item pictures;
+	Lots of affix optimization works;
+	Fleshdoom quest level 3 was modified to get rid of entry point cheese (as in TH1);


	v0.5000 (21:37 24.07.2018), "Switch Twitch"

+	Named after Fluke;
+	Loot segregation taken one step further: players will now find less item types they cannot use (or can't use effectively);
+	Greatly revised item availability by subclass in SP mode:
	DEX axes only for Shugoki, two-handed battle staves only for Monk, crossbows only for Warriors and Savages, etc.;
+	Minor tweaks in Perk balance (some fine-tunings in 'Here and Now!' requirements);
+	Iron Maiden items (helms/armors/bucklers) now give basic thorns damage;
+	Added Thorns series affixes. They are generated exclusively on Iron Maiden-specific items;
+	Bloodbane is now not triple immune;
+	Knight class renamed to Templar;
+	Revised affixes again. Finally some good news! We are approaching affix stability stage. Should be there in 1-2 build release time. I really hope so;
+	Added a line of unique boots;
+	Added a line of fast crossbows for Iron Maiden (now she's ready to be played, more or less);
+	Flasks can be thrown now (for now, as arrows), allowed to be equipped;

	v0.5004 (13:07 28.07.2018), hotfix

+	Mana Shield works like before, previous fix cancelled until it can be re-written properly;
+	Flasks no longer crash game when durability depletes;
+	Flasks durability loss obeys common item break rules now: if currentDUR reaches 1, and maxDUR is depleted then until it reaches zero (then the item is destroyed);
+	Flasks no longer can fly over walls and obstacles (a bug is a bug);
+	Stat rerolling shrine doesnt give free 5 stats now if stat limit was reached;

	Warrior/Inquisitor/Templar: 1h-sword or 1h mace + shield = high damage, xbow = high, else = low,
	Guardian: Axe / 2h-sharp/ 2h-blunt = high, xbow = high, else = low,

	Rogue: unchanged,
	Assassin: moderate with evrything ([clvl * cSTR] / 100 ),
	Iron Maiden: low (supposed to damage through thorned items),
	Bombardier: low,
	Savage: high (but bad with dual wielding),
	Berserker: high,
	Executioner: very high (bad with dual wielding),
	Thraex/Murmillo/Secutor: bad with dual wielding and axe, all else = high,
	Dimachaerus: decent with bow, excellent when dual wielding (especially if weapons are of the same type), all else = low;
+	Added 1 more unique ring;
+	Added 6 uniques on uID#2003 (Great pickaxe). Total uniques 190 now;
+	Fixed a bug where looting Slain Hero corpse would freeze the game for Shugoki class (tried to drop staff and there is none for Shugoki);


	v0.6201 (7:58 25.11.2018)

+	Iron Maiden base damage formula updated:
	Crossbow: (clvl * cSTR ) / 80,

	all else: (clvl * cSTR ) / 500;
+	Rewritten Gladiator base damage rules, should be as intended now;
+	Build 0.6200 got released with Remotery tool not deactivated, it's a debugger and it started causing crashes with line 1580 error report. Now it's fixed,

+	IM base damage set to clvl*str / 70 with xbows;
+	Fixed IM base damage with all weapon+shield combos;
+	Fixed elemental arrow (monster to player) overdose damage and their Manashield penetration (hopefully, some feed would be nice!);

	Note: for SP (thanks to segregation) there are per-class rules now that give actually droppable item types and are useful;
+	Updated ReadMe file (screen mode info);

+	Modified life regeneration speed bonuses for classes:
	Gladiators: 0 (now basic, without +1 bonus),
	Savage/Berserker: as before (+1),
	Executioner: multiplied by 3, +5 (basically, that's triple life regen speed plus 5 points on top of that),

+	Thraex class now gets no penalty for using swords against Undead (because their Sica swords are like this, and they know how to use them properly),
	Note: swords won't give you the +50% dmg against Undead in this case as a blunt weapon would do, just you don't have the -50% total damage for a malus;
+	Old Ironman bug is checked: there is no bug. No objects remain unchecked. Ironman dungeon object clear counter works without bugs;
+	Executioner is given personal GET_HIT and DYING sounds;
+	Monk class: sweep damage is (37-75)% instead of standard (25-50)% ;
+	Fixed a bug with Ghouls getting +health from arrows on MP Doom (presumably on MP Purgatory  level 7 as well),
	Note: I'm not 100% sure it's fixed, I had to re-write that code from scratch using my TH1 asm code as reference, but I hope I did well;
+	Updated some class pics in meta menu;
+	Turned off automatic flip animation adjustment for staff type items;
+	Effigies now have flip animation of teddy bear;
+	Grave Digger type of monsters now can growl or moan when they see you;
+	Greeting sound also added for boars, quasits, liches, cacodemons;
+	Added 2 more trigger sounds for regular goats and reduced chances for them;
+	Fixed (again) weapon rack crash. It will drop gold if no suitable item is found,
	Note: it was staff or flask type of would-be drop that seemed to cause the trouble,
	Note: staff type drops still are not limited by MAG requirement, and too powerful items are dropped, but it's better than a crash, we'll try to fix it better later,
	Note: word is this fix can influence some other item desynch issues in a good way, including multiplayer coop item desynch;
+	Reflect now has ability to score critical hits. Only Iron Maiden provides substantial damage with it though;
+	Adria can recharge staves (or rather items) in right hand and in secondary item slot;

+	PvM arrow damage was x2 in v0.7000 because of an error, now fixed;
+	Sharpshooter new base damage formula with bow is: ( (cSTR + cDEX) * clvl) / 90 ;
+	Fix to magic arrows: now multi magic arrows are allowed on any items, and damage is summed from them all;
+	Added support for new affixes:
	+X% damage to spells (e.g., +8% Arcane Star damage), accounted for in spellbook,
	+X% damage to elements (spell group by type of damage) (e.g., +X% to lightning damage), affects magic damage from weapons as well,
	+X to Y spell damage (e.g., +13-19 Fire Bolt damage), accounted for in spellbook,
	+X to Y element (spell group by type of damage) damage (e.g., +4-6 to arcane damage), affects magic damage from weapons as well,
	Note: these are being prepared mostly for uniques, and maybe as a substitute on some of the currently less attractive affixes;

+	Added 32 uniques on uID#2008 (Ring);

+	Fixed a bug with wrong Nightmare/Ironman mode exit;
+	Iron Maiden speed changes (affects Bombardier as well):
	2 swords / 2 blunts: frame 10,
	sword+shield / blunt+shield: frame 9,
	xbow: frame 10,
	Note: that should fix odd speeds with her and even out swinging speeds for all weapon coombos, plus makes her a little faster with xbows,
	Note: dualwielding will be slower for her, favoured style now is 1h weapon + shield, or xbow (against retreating ranged attackers);
+	Following quest levels now give 50% more experience, to make them more attractive:
	KING_LEORICS_TOMB,
	BONE_CHAMBER,
	THE_INFESTED_CELLAR,
	POISONED_WATER_SUPPLY,
	ARCHBISHOP_LAZARUS_LAIR,

+	Fixed a bug with Holy arrow bows not hitting non-Undead at all with missiles;
+	Base/unique item array size is auto-adjusted, makes executable smaller in size (21mb -> 5mb);

+	Added 3 more base items of "Claw" type. Now there are 13 tiers;

+	Added new variations of starting weapons to equip Mage subclasses with proper tools at the start;
+	The problem with jewelry sometimes being repairable at Griswold's is fixed now (hopefully);
+	Updated spell icon design. Now the icons look more 3D and in Diablo 2 style. I also expanded spell icon database to 203 icons (was 50),
	Note: it may seem odd at first but you get used to it quickly, as with the expanded inventory, and extra icons will be needed for new spells anyway;

+	Fixed the bug with unique items being picked randomly from the line, which produced low level trash uniques too often,
	Note: this may result in some of the existing uniques morphing into higher level variations for the given uID, beware,
	Note: otherwise, expect more quality uniques to start dropping;
+	Multi-frame spells from monsters (Inferno, Lightningm Flash) are getting nerfed. They were broken (minimum damage limits too high),

	Lite/Flash:	dlvl / 6 + diff (diff = horror 0, purg 4, doom 8),
	Other spells:	dlvl / 4 + diff (diff = horror 0, purg 6, doom 12),

	v0.9000 (14:53 29.04.2019), "Reaching the Innermost" (Shape of Despair)

	Warning! Read this carefully before upgrading.
	This update reformats perks and items completely.
	Summoner classes are ready. But not for cooperative play. We still need work to do in that area.
	Loading game from previous releases will most likely result in gamecrash.
	Starting a new game session might work but it's possible you will crash while browsing through perks.
	If not, you will still experience a lot of magic / rare item morphing.
	The best way is to just start a new character.
	If you don't want to upgrade because of that and want to upgrade when version 1.0000 gets released, then don't update and stay on v0.8439.
	Also, subsequent patches will likely cause affix morphing.

+	Added new prefixes with acid / holy / arcane hit damage for melee weapons;
+	Expanded some affixes to allow for generation of low level affixes on some items (jewelry and staves in particular);
+	Added some low level suffixes that boost SLVL for certain spells;

+	Inactive spell icon colors updated;
