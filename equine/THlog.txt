+	Obsolete hotkey information (Q - questbook, B - spellbook, S - speedbook) no longer  displayed;
+	Added another unique based on gladiator's helmet;
+	When automap is active, chests will be highlighted;


	v1.149h, (20:42 28.01.2013), Patch

+	Fixed a bug that caused Hell music play in MP Catacombs;
+	Fixed Necromorb AI missile type (was broken);


	v1.149m, (23:50 01.02.2013), Patch

+	Monsters no longer leave shadows in coop if killed by more than one player;
+	Monster multidrop (duped) in coop fixed (hopefully);
+	Death tolls are now shown in values;
+	Character passive melee damage resistance modified to:
	Gladiator: [ 20 + ( Rnd[baseVIT/8] + 36) ]%,
	Paladin: [ 15 + ( Rnd[baseVIT/8] + 36) ]%,
	Monk: [ 13 + (CLVL/16) + ( Rnd[baseVIT/8] + 36) ]%;
+	Cain's dialogue menu is given color support for unique and set items;
+	An attempt made [by Yarik] to fix hit sounds in PvP Ranged (magic). Not sure how it worked out;
+	A weird rune functionality programmatic fix [by Yarik] that should prevent potential memory corruption (yeah, there's little that I understand about it, too);


	v1.149n, (13:25 04.02.2013), Patch

+	Removed 'Increased Fury duration' check from PvM Ranged to prevent it from interfering with Gargoyle stoning state (this _probably_ resulted in their squatting sometimes);


	v1.149p, (16:32 11.02.2013), Patch

+	Fixed a bug that allowed lifestealing in PvP through utilizing ILS items;
+	[Desert Dragon]: added support for Windows 8,
	Note: under Windows 8, set TH.exe file settings to "run in Win98 compatibility mode" and "use 640x480 resolution",
	Note: if you're running Win8, try with these file settings and without them, to test it, and report to me. I'd like to know how it works (I can't test myslef because of running Win7);


	v1.149q, (21:04 12.02.2013), Patch

+	Minor town sector 1 architecture adjustments and fixes;
+	[Desert Dragon]: win8 support fixed,
	Note: under Windows 8, set TH.exe file settings to "run in Win95 compatibility mode" and "use 640x480 resolution",


	v1.149u, (13:19 15.02.2013), Full Release

+	Dregbez room has 2x more doors now, Pinky/Ceromorth - 1,5x more;
+	Combination of sharp + blunt produced no effect of increased damage vs undead/demons with these effects active on player, now fixed,
	Note: mixed style dual wielders will benefit from this;
+	PvM Melee crit chances revised for character classes:
	Paldn:	10+(CLVL/4)% for 250% dmg,
	Scout:	(CLVL/2)% for 200% dmg,
	Mage:	(CLVL/2)% for 200% dmg,

	Assa:	6+(CLVL/4)% for 500% dmg,
	Gladr:	10+(CLVL/2)% for 200% dmg;
+	Additional check added to monster stun formula. Excluding stun-immune monsters, damaging a monster for { ( ( monster_baseHP * 1,5 ) + monster_currentHP ) / 8 } of its maximum life (or stronger) stuns it now,
	Note: this requires damaging monster for 31% of its maximum HP when its current HP is at its full, and damaging it for about 21% when its current HP is at 22%,
	Note: in other words, to stun a monster that has 1000 of 1000 HP, you need to deal 310 damage, and to stun it when it has 220 of 1000 HP will take "only" 210 damage,
	Note: minimum is 18%, but you won't see that as it will kill the monster anyway ^_^,
	Note: yes, it does make killing monsters more pleasant, and yes, it does make the game a little easier;

+	There will no longer be scroll chunks scattered through Crypt levels 21-23 as this now is a part of 'Horazon's Demons' quest;
+	Fixed a bug that made Magic Rock morph into a mundane item (usually, mana potion) some 5 secondds after being picked up (or dropped from its table?);
+	Revised values for resist all prefix series, to make them more attractive early on;
+	Abyss levels will now have shrines (currently: cauldrons, when I'm in a mood for drawing some guts that might look like shrine, I'll do that): 0-1 on Horror, 0-2 on Purgatory and 0-3 on Doom;
