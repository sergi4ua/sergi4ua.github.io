    <p><b>Mod description from ModDB</b></p>
    <p>Diablo Infernity searches to add things to enhance d1 gameplay.</p><p>The mod allows you to import your vanilla character and continue playing! Right now Infernity contains both the original game and an additional difficulty level. Until you reach that new difficulty, you are having 100% vanilla experience + Quality of Life enhancements (alt highlighting items, monster health bar, additional inventory tabs etc.). The real fun begins after level 30, when you can access hell and inferno difficulties. On Inferno magic and unique items can have an additional affix, which doesn't follow the usual limitations - for example you could get a ring with +2 to spells or 300% damage to demons. For latest release visit the github website, updates are being released almost daily! Also there's an accurate changelog / featurelist there : ) You can find the mod on reddit and github, where you can find latest release and accurate changelog/feature list. </p>
    <b>Here you can find all versions of this mod.</b><br>
