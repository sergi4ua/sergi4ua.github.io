# Apple deprecates OpenGL for iOS and Mac OS

Finally, a non Syobon Action X related post! But seriously, this news is just... bad for any open source project out there.

As you may know, preety much ANY open source project relies on OpenGL support (both software and hardware) and if that support is absent in the OS the application will not run.

Ofcourse, Apple only deprecates OpenGL and not removing it completely... YET! Time will tell when Apple completely removes OpenGL support from their future OSes.
