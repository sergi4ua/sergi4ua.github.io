Syobon Action X is a fan sequel, created by Sergi4UA in 2018 (original Syobon Action was created by Chiku).

In this game, you play as a cat and try to complete each level without dying (and believe me, you will die, alot). There are many things that can lead to death, like invisible coin blocks, breaking bricks when you touch them, crushers, etc.).

This game features a level editor, new gameplay mechanics, new physics and ofcourse, new levels! 

It currently under active development and will be always available for free.

#### Features:
- Level Editor
- New physics
- New mechanics and objects that can kill you
- Real 60 FPS
- Open source (GameMaker project file is available at GitHub)
- Custom Music support
- More to come!

The game was created on Game Maker 8.1 Standard.
